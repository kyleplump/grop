# grop

`grop` is a small utility to search for a query string in text files.  It's essentially a less feature-complete `grep`.  It was created to continue learning Go.  

## Features
- Searches each file in the target destination in a separate `goroutine`
- Highlights the queried word in the output

## Usage
Run the executable with 2 flags: `d` (folder to search), and `q` (query)
